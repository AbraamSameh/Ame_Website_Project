# Project Title

Âme is a french word that means a soul and that's what we found most suitable for an animal care website's name.  Through Âme you can adopt your pereferred pets, learn more about adoption , or even get a plan for your own pet.
It's a bootsrap responsive website with almost every bootsrap component, grat animations, and fixed images background that make our website entertaining and more visual appealing.
